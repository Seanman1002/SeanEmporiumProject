                    Hi, I’m Sean, a passionate and self-taught web and software developer. In 2024, I embarked on a journey to master programming and development, teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and C++. My goal is to create impactful projects while continuously expanding my skills and knowledge.

Living with autism and ADHD has given me a unique perspective, enabling me to approach challenges with creativity and innovation. My ability to hyper-focus allows me to solve complex problems, while my out-of-the-box thinking leads to solutions that stand out. These qualities drive me to excel in web and software development, turning ideas into reality.

I am committed to becoming one of the best developers in the field, driven by a strong work ethic and a dedication to reliability. With several exciting projects planned for the future, I aim to create solutions that not only showcase my abilities but also contribute to meaningful advancements in technology.

Let’s build something extraordinary together!
