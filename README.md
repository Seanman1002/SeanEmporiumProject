# SeanEmporiumProject
This is my first major project as a self taught developer. 
this website is mainly to showcase any and all future projects for anyone interested in what i make and to show off to potential employers. 
I plan on updating this website more in the future, especially updated with finished projects and the links to download them on this page.
if you have any issues, please email me at gamernerd1002@gmail.com and please keep in mind that i am still a beginner at this programming stuff, so just bear that in mind.
To anyone, who uses my website or even browses to my github page, Thank You! :D
